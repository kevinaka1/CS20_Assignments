                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Kevin, a junior at Tufts University with a passion for real estate media. I’ve dedicated my
                    studies to understanding the intricacies of photography and videography, honing my skills to capture
                    the essence of properties in stunning detail. My journey into this field has been driven by a love
                    for
                    storytelling through visuals, and I believe every home has a unique story waiting to be told.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Why Work With Me?</strong></p>
                <ul class="sublist">
                    <li>
                        <span>Fresh Perspective:</span> As a student, I bring a youthful and innovative approach to real
                        estate
                        media. I’m constantly exploring new techniques and trends, ensuring your properties are
                        showcased in a modern and engaging way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Dedication to Excellence:</span> I’m committed to delivering high-quality work that meets
                        your
                        expectations. I pay close attention to detail and strive to exceed your vision for every
                        project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Personalized Service:</span> Working with me means you’ll receive a tailored experience. I
                        take the
                        time to understand your needs and preferences, ensuring that the final product aligns perfectly
                        with your goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Affordability:</span> As I build my portfolio, I offer competitive rates without
                        compromising on
                        quality. This allows you to get professional media services while supporting my growth in the
                        industry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Passion for Real Estate:</span> I’m genuinely passionate about real estate and its
                        potential to
                        transform lives. This passion translates into my work, as I strive to capture not just
                        properties but the lifestyles they offer.
                    </li>
                </ul>
